- remove yt-dlp.exe and use system version instead (so it works on Windows + Mac + Linux)
- stop writing out text files for pinned and shoutouts and pay posts
- log errors to a file in the current working folder so we know which posts failed
- legacy rename script:
    - depending on environment, write either bash script or batch file (currently only latter)
    - picture series are not writing to legacy rename script
- make console log nicer (clean up or offer debug levels, use colours etc)
- is there a way to make yt-dlp download faster?
